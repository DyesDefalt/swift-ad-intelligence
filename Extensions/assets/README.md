# Extension Icons

Add the following icon files for the Chrome extension (export from `docs/gapah-logo.svg` or use placeholders):

- `icon-16.png` (16×16) – toolbar
- `icon-48.png` (48×48) – extension management
- `icon-128.png` (128×128) – Chrome Web Store

Place them in `public/` so they are copied to the build output. The WXT manifest will reference them from the build output directory.
